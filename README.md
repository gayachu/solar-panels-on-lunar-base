# Lunar Base Solar Panel Degradation Simulation

This project simulates the **long-term degradation of solar panels on a lunar base**, accounting for radiation, micrometeorite impacts, and crack propagation.  
The lunar environment is harsh, and understanding how panels degrade is critical for sustainable power generation on the Moon.

## Features
- **Radiation damage**: gradual yearly loss of panel efficiency  
- **Micrometeorite impacts**: random strikes that cause localized damage  
- **Crack propagation**: cascading spread of damage via a Laplacian-style kernel  
- **Visualization**: heatmaps of panel health over time
